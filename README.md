I’m a software engineer with 5+ years of experience designing and building production-grade applications. Over the years I’ve worked with a range of teams and businesses, helping deliver software from the early idea stage through architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, and long-term maintenance.

My main focus is Python and Django, and I’ve worked extensively with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and MongoDB. I enjoy designing clean, scalable systems, improving database performance, and building reliable backend services that are easy to maintain and evolve.

I’m comfortable working with OOP and software design patterns, test-driven development, asynchronous and concurrent programming, and distributed systems using tools like RabbitMQ. I value readable code, thoughtful architecture, and collaborative development using Git and agile workflows.

Outside of work, I like cycling, hiking, and exploring new places — and I’m always learning something new in software engineering or computer science to sharpen my skills and stay current with the field.
